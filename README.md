# BikeMechanicApp
This is my Bicycle Mechanic Android app built in Java using Android Studio, with an API built in Laravel on an external server. This was a project to build an appointment based app for a bicycle mechanic, to enable him to manage his appointments more efficiently.
Note: The server is currently down at the moment.
