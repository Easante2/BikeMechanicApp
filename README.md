# BikeMechanicApp
This is my Bicycle Mechanic Android app built in Java using Android Studio, with an API built in Laravel on an external server. This is an appointment based app built for a bicycle mechanic, to enable the mechanic to manage his appointments more efficiently.
Note: The server is currently down at the moment.
